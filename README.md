# CuSell
  We are aiming at providing all CUHK students the most convenient and reliable platform where they can trade their second-hand merchandise. We also focus on minimizing the procedures and accelerating the speed when the users are dealing with each other. Hopefully, users will be able to finish trading and transactions within a day.
  This platform will offer the users an opportunity to search and gather all the merchandise information they need on a single page, where they can figure out what is the best choice for them efficiently. Additionally, all the items to be traded on this platform shall be posted with authentic photos and detailed descriptions, and the buyers are allowed to have a conversation with the sellers to negotiate the price of the merchandise. Thus, both parties of the transactions will be satisfied with the trading results.
  Furthermore, we pay significant attention to the safety and security issues of our project, and these two qualities should be maximized if the users choose to trade through our platform.
  Eventually, we are dedicated to building our product to be the best platform at the current stage that any CUHK students could think of to perform their second-hand merchandise trading.
